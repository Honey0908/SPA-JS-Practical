                    <p>
                        I’ve been called a ‘pragmatic’ designer.
                        I take that as a compliment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My professional work slants towards product design that can make a measurable impact. Usability
                        over
                        style. Stylish when called for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Learning from your customers and shipping delightful, yet useful tools for them is both
                        rewarding
                        and challenging, which is why I've been drawn to working with early products, especially those
                        where
                        you can get to know your users personally.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        I’ve had the privilege of working with some great teams on some truly impactful products, and
                        have
                        learned a thing or two along the way. I bring that experience to new ventures and try to share
                        it
                        with folks through mentoring and writing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tend to think about design like a founder, because I’ve been one. Balancing process and
                        instinct,
                        the goal is to find harmony between user delight and business strategy, as fast as you can
                        deliver
                        quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        If this seems like your cup of tea, I'd be pleased to chat about your project needs. My
                        availability
                        is below.
